NyTaxi Ride-Hailing ETL Pipeline
Problem Statement
In the 21st century, ride-hailing transportation has surged, disrupting traditional taxi businesses. The success of ride-hailing services is attributed to the convenience of passengers booking rides directly from their phones. This success has resulted in a substantial migration of individuals to these platforms, generating vast amounts of data that can be leveraged for analysis. The objective of this project is to develop an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for ingesting data into a PostgreSQL database. The entire pipeline is encapsulated within a Docker container, and a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline, powered by GitHub Actions, is implemented to automate the versioned deployment of the Docker image to the DockerHub registry.

Tools Used
The chosen tools for this project encompass a comprehensive set of technologies to ensure efficiency and reliability:

ETL Framework:

Apache Ariflow: A robust ETL tool providing a user-friendly interface for designing data flows and automating data movement between systems.
Data Storage:

PostgreSQL: A reliable relational database management system, selected for its ability to store structured data efficiently.
Data Processing:

Apache Spark: Employed for large-scale data processing, Spark facilitates complex transformations and analytics on the ride-hailing dataset.
Containerization:

Docker: Used to containerize the entire ETL pipeline, promoting consistency and portability across diverse environments.
CI/CD:

GitHub Actions: Orchestrates the CI/CD pipeline, automating tasks such as running tests, building Docker images, and pushing versioned images to the DockerHub registry.
Version Control:

Git: Facilitates collaborative development, version control, and efficient tracking of changes within the ETL pipeline codebase.
Monitoring and Logging:

Prometheus: Monitors the performance and health of the ETL pipeline.
ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana): Manages and analyzes logs generated during the ETL process.
Security:

Implementation of secure communication protocols ensures safe data transfer and storage.
Encryption of sensitive data guarantees the confidentiality of passenger information.
Extended Information
Data Sources:

Data originates from various sources, including mobile apps, website interactions, and IoT devices within vehicles. This encompasses ride requests, passenger details, and trip information.
Data Schema:

A well-defined data schema for the PostgreSQL database, encompassing tables for rides, passengers, drivers, and relevant entities. This includes specifying relationships and data types.
ETL Logic:

Extraction: Retrieve data from diverse sources such as APIs, databases, and streaming platforms.
Transformation: Apply necessary transformations, clean, and structure the data for storage.
Loading: Load the processed data into the PostgreSQL database.
Scalability:

Design the ETL pipeline to scale horizontally, accommodating increasing data volumes and meeting the growing demand for ride-hailing services.
Error Handling:

Robust error-handling mechanisms to ensure data integrity. Logging errors facilitates thorough analysis and troubleshooting.
Documentation:

Comprehensive documentation covering the setup, configuration, and operation of the ETL pipeline. This includes instructions for developers, operators, and end-users.
Compliance:

Adherence to data protection regulations and privacy laws. Implementation of data anonymization mechanisms when necessary.
By integrating these tools and considering the extended information, the NyTaxi Ride-Hailing ETL Pipeline is poised to be a robust and efficient solution, aligning with the project's overarching objectives.
